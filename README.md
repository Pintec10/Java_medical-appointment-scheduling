# About this app
This is a very simple Java app made to test JPA/Hibernate functionalities (Embedded classes, OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships), which stores medical appointment information (patients, doctors, and appointments).  
There is no API here, as the focus was to just study JPA/hibernate.  
Methods to create Patient, Doctor and Appointment instances are provided in the Tests package.
